# Correlation Between Testosterone and Health Indicators
### Group 49: Pengzhe Lin, Mihir Barlinge, Ashton Ma

## About
This interactive web app explores how cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal health indicators relate to testosterone levels among adult males in the NHANES dataset. It combines regression modeling and visualization to help users identify which everyday health metrics are most strongly associated with hormonal balance.

## Interactivity & Interpretation
The plot displays a fitted regression line with a 95% confidence interval. Below the plot, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and p-value quantify the direction, strength, and significance of the relationship.
                 
## Project Context
This project investigates how lifestyle and physiological factors jointly influence testosterone levels. Results suggest that higher BMI and resting pulse are associated with lower testosterone, while stronger renal health (urine flow) predicts higher levels. The model emphasizes interconnected health systems rather than isolated variables.
